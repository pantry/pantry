# Configure where to send Pantry logs.
# Can be one of three values:
#
# - stdout / nil -- Send to STDOUT
# - syslog       -- Send to the local syslog daemon.
# - [file path]  -- Write logs to the given file
log_to: /var/log/pantry-server.log

# Minimum log output.
# Levels are defined as:
#
# - fatal
# - error
# - warn
# - info
# - debug
#
# Each level includes all levels above it.
# log_level: info

# Specify the Syslog program name
# In the case that log_to is set to 'syslog' you can set the program name
# for filtering messages.
# syslog_program_name: pantry

# Location on the file system where all persistent files are stored.
# This directory is available in code as Pantry.root
# Must be read and writable by the user running pantry-server
data_dir: /var/lib/pantry

networking:
  # IP address or Domain the Pantry Server binds to
  server_host: 0.0.0.0

  # Port over which this Server publishes messages to Clients
  # pub_sub_port: 23001

  # Port over which Clients communicate back to this Server
  # receive_port: 23002

  # Port over which File data is passed between Client and Server
  # file_service_port: 23003

  # Security strategy to use in communication
  #
  # Defaults to nil, meaning no built-in security.
  # Also available is "curve" which turns on ZeroMQ's Curve encryption
  # as seen here: http://api.zeromq.org/4-0:zmq-curve
  # This is not the default because Curve has not yet been fully vetted by
  # the crypto community
  #
  # If this Server is configured for curve security then all connecting
  # Clients must also be configured for curve and be given this Server's
  # public encryption key.
